# Kaggle dataset on medical costs

A study of data from the Kaggle personal medical costs dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance), looking for patterns, behaviors, and information that may be useful. Throughout the document, different sections can be seen, highlighting the EDA part and the creation and evaluation of models.

The Exploratory Data Analysis part searches for patterns in the variations of the variables, relationships between them, and performs featuring engineering. The model part creates different model options both with the initial model, as well as with the cleaned model and the application of featuring engineering, to finally obtain metrics and perform a brief test.
